- A nautical themed design was created
- Various `animation` elements were added
- Custom `internationalization` was implemented, supporting Estonian, English and Russian languages
- Powerful tools like `quick navigation`, `navigation breadcrumbs`, also product `sorting`, `filtering` and `search` were implemented
- `Responsive` `cross-platform` `adaptive` layout was implemented with support for mobile, tablet and all screen sizes, including via classic `@media` and progressive `@container` queries
- Convenient viewing of product photos is implemented using the `Swiper.JS` library
- A user-friendly interface was made for the custom wire rope swaging program
